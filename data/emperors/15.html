        Antoninus Pius (Latin: Titus Fulvus Aelius Hadrianus Antoninus Augustus Pius;[2][3] 19 September 86 CE – 7 March 161 CE), also known as Antoninus, was Roman Emperor from 138 to 161. He was one of the Five Good Emperors in the Nerva–Antonine dynasty and the Aurelii.[4]
    </p><p>
        He acquired the name Pius after his accession to the throne, either because he compelled the Senate to deify his adoptive father Hadrian,[5] or because he had saved senators sentenced to death by Hadrian in his later years.[6] He died of illness in 161 and was succeeded by his adopted sons Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus as co-emperors.
