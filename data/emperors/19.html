    <p>Didius Julianus (Latin: Marcus Didius Severus Julianus Augustus;[1] 30 January 133 or 2 February 137 – 1 June 193) was Roman emperor for nine weeks during the year 193.
    </p><p>
        Julianus ascended the throne after buying it from the Praetorian Guard, who had assassinated his predecessor Pertinax. This led to the Roman Civil War of 193–197. Julianus was ousted and sentenced to death by his successor, Septimius Severus.</p>
