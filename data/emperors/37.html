    <p>Aemilianus (Latin: Marcus Aemilius Aemilianus Augustus;[1] c. 207/213 â€“ 253), also known as Aemilian, was Roman Emperor for three months in 253.
    </p><p>
        Commander of the Moesian troops, he obtained an important victory against the invading Goths and was, for this reason, acclaimed Emperor by his army. He then moved quickly to Italy, where he defeated Emperor Trebonianus Gallus, only to be killed by his own men when another general, Valerian, proclaimed himself Emperor and moved against Aemilian with a larger army.</p>
